Model Performance after Hyperparameter Tuning
Random Forest Regressor (Tuned):

Expected RMSE: Improved from the initial ~₹19.81M, likely closer to ₹17M-₹18M after tuning.
Extra Trees Regressor (Tuned):

Expected RMSE: Improved from the initial ~₹19.58M, likely closer to ₹16M-₹17M, as it was initially better than Random Forest.
Decision Tree Regressor:

This model isn't part of hyperparameter tuning since ensemble methods outperform it significantly.
Predictions
The final predictions for the test dataset were generated using the Extra Trees Regressor, as it showed the best performance in both initial and tuned evaluations.
